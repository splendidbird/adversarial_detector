# Adversarial Image Attack Sensor

A tool to evaluate whether an input image has been attacked (as an adversarial example) to fool conventional classifiers.
A score is output from the binary classifier, based on which the input image can be categorized into 'Safe', 'Suspicious' and 'Danger'.

Two deployments - stand-alone and cloud:

Stand-alone version is based on a tool kit for the
[Competition on Adversarial Attacks and Defenses 2018](http://caad.geekpwn.org/) CTF @ LV

The cloud version is deployed on AWS for real-time classification, with API available in the future.

## Abstract
An RGB image can be represented by a 3-way tensor whose dimension is specified by the width, length and depth (colors) of the image. At each depth (color), the 2d matrix can be considered as a covariance matrix between pixel rows and columns. For most unperturbed original images, information (variance) contained in the tensor (or covariance matrice) is more than enough for a basic classifier like inception-v4 to make accurate classification, and this is however unlikely the case for an image with targeted perturbations. Investigations on the core ranks (or number of singular values at each depth) of the tensor required for a conventional classifier like inception-v4 to make final decision reveal notable difference between original image and adversarial image with targeted perturbations. Therefore, an easy-to-implement sensor to detect targeted adversarial image attack is built with a conventional classifier. 

## Preliminary Results



## Algorithm

## Algorithm Fundamentals
1. Singular value decomposition for Images Reconstruction
Singular Value Decomposition is applied to image matrix A (Eq.1), and first n singular values (Eq.3) are preserved to reconstruct the image matrix An (Eq.4)

2. Tensor decomposition for Image Reconstruction
The Tucker Tensor decomposition decomposes a tensor into a core tensor and multiple matrices for scaling along each mode. 
The RGB image is treated as a 3-way tensor, and its Tucker core is another 3-way tensor with reduced scale. Tucker Decomposition is applied to image tensor X (Eq.5) with the rank of the core set to be (n x n x 1), which can then be truncated to reconstruct the image.

## Installation (Stand-alone)

### Prerequisites

Following software required to use this package:

* Python 2.7 with installed [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
  and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) packages.

Following libs are required by some attacks/defenses, but not all of them.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [cleverhans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans)

### Defenses
* adv_inception_v3(/defense/)
* Guided_Denoise_14
  * Dataset2 class has been created to only load one image from input folder
    * Redefine functions __getitem__ and __len__
  * Move inference code into function of event handler, which is triggered when a new file is created.
* Random_Denoise_14
  * Add random padding on to Guided_Denoise
  * Classify 1 picture needs **4 seconds** when iteration = 30.
* Random_padding_IresV2
  * **Slow!!**. Classify 1 picture needs **5-6 seconds** when iteration = 30.
* Diff_Random_Denoise_14_pytorch
  * Difference filter of two defenses: Random padding and Denoise. it is pytorch version. The random padding is implemented with inception_resnet_v2 instead of ens_adv_inception_resnet_v2 in the original version above, becuase I only found the pre-trained weights for the former.
* Diff_cv2_Random_Denoise_14_pytorch
  * Difference filter of two defenses: (cv2_Random padding) and (Denoise). it is pytorch version. The random padding is implemented with inception_resnet_v2 instead of ens_adv_inception_resnet_v2 in the original version above, becuase I only found the pre-trained weights for the former.
* [Not work]Diff_Random_Denoise
  * defense.py: Seperate two classifier into two watchdog functions to handler two events: file creation and file deletion, sperately. But it still doesn't work.
  * defense2.py: Try to combine tensorflow and pytorch into the same function, but it doesn't work. Tenserflow fails to get CUDNN hanle after pytorch code.
  pytorch will be out of memeory after tensorflow code.
  Don't know how to fix it.

### Download check points and images

To be able to run the examples you need to download checkpoints for provided models
as well as dataset.

To all checkpoints run following:

```bash
./download_checkpoints.sh
```
To download randomly 100 images run following:

```bash
./download_images_100.sh
```
Or you can define number of images:

```bash
./download_images.sh <output_folder> <number of images>
```
